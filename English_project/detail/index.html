The continuous arrow bamboo grass slopes along the way are like the grasslands of the Alps reaching to the sky. On the ridgeline close to the top of the mountain, a huge reflective plate was erected, which is the most obvious symbol of Hehuan North Peak. After that, the field of vision became wider and wider, and sometimes you can enjoy the sea of clouds rolling in the valley. The top of the mountain has an excellent outlook, and you can have a panoramic view of the distant and near mountains such as Yushan, Snow Mountain, Hehuan Peak, Qilai and Nanhu. The total length is two kilometers, and it takes 3 hours to go back and forth. The road surface is relatively primitive and difficult to climb, and the difficulty is relatively high.
